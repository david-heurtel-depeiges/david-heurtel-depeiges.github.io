Hi! I'm David Heurtel-Depeiges, a first year PhD Student at [MILA - Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) in Montreal, supervised by [Sarath Chandar](https://sarathchandar.in/). I am widely interested in Machine Learning but more specifically, my research interests are the following topics:
- **Deep Probabilistic Models** with a focus on helping solve complex inference problems for scientific applications. Currently working on **Discrete Diffusion**, **Consistency Matching** and **Inverse Problems**.
- **AI Safety** with a focus on **Robust Alignment**, **Model Interpretability** and **Model Editing**.

Formerly, I was a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, London, supervised by Anian Ruoss and Tim Genewein. Before that, I was also a Research Analyst at the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/), Flatiron Institute, NY, where I was supervised by [Bruno Regaldo-Saint Blancard](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~bregaldosaintblancard/) and [Ruben Ohana](https://rubenohana.github.io/).

I graduated in 2024 from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) and the [MVA program (Mathematics, Vision, Learning)](https://www.master-mva.com/), which means that I belong to the X2020 class (yes, I know, it's confusing, we number our classes from the first year of the program).
